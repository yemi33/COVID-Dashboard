## Introduction

This was a final project for Spring 2019 Course 'Software Design'.
This was my first ever web application development experience! 

## Requirements to Run 
1. Flask installed
2. psycopg2 installed
3. a perlman server (see notes section)

## How to Run the Program (On LocalHost)

1. Navigate to the `COVID-Dashboard/web/flask_integration` folder
2. Type `FLASK_APP=webapp.py flask run` on the terminal

## How to Run the Program (On Perlman server)

1. Connect to the perlman server (login required)
`ssh yourUserName@perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu`
2. Navigate to `web/flask_integration` folder
3. type `python3 webapp.py perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu (port number)`
4. Navigate to the local host address on the browser 

## Notes
1. The website was built on Perlman server which is an educational database server that was used in the course. This server only works on the Carleton VPN. 
2. I forgot what port number was my own port..
